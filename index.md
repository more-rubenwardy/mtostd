	Note: this project is a work in progress,
	and is yet to achieve its potential.<br />
	The name is a placeholder.
	It's meant to be more of a collection of guidelines and lists to
	help make mods interact with each other better.
</aside>

## Aims

To provide better inter-mod support in Minetest by:

* Providing resources such as [lists of known groups](mtostd/groups/list.html).
* Providing [a library](mtstdlib.html) to
	* manage multi-mod dependencies.
	* abstract content and functionality providers from mods.
	* adding missing groups to items.
